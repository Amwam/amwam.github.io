Allowing developers to view the reasons for a change in more\ndetail.\n\n### Autosquashing commits\nRebasing commit allows you to keep your history linear. \nWhile not everyone agrees whether or not you should be maintaining a linear history, \nIt is almost definitely (in my opinion) and good idea to keep your local branches ordered appropriately, by showing changes as a series of changes to be applied.\nIdeally each change is isolated from the others (within reason), and can be applied separately.\n\nDevelopment rarely works like this. Too often have I made some changes, progressed a bit further, and realised I there were more changes to make in\nthat original commit.\nMaybe it was a left over debug statement, or some missing config, or even a chunk of functionality I didn't originally think about. \nTypically most people would just make a new commit with these changes, and leave it at that. \n\nGit has the ability to squash commits into another, allowing you to make several small changes, and then bundle them up into one, more appropiate,\ncommit.\nThis get a bit complicated, when you start to make changes that aren't in order.\n\nLuckily, git has that solved, with `--fixup` and `--squash`. These let you commit changes, and at the same time specify that they should be part of a\nprevious commit.\nThe `fixup` option will allow you to `amend` a previous commit, and not change the original commit  message.\nThe `squash` options, will also `amend` a previous commit, but it will also give you the change to alter the commit message.\n\nTo use these, just prepare you staging area, like normal (`git add` or `git add -p`), then commit with:\n\n    `git commit --fixup=\u003cprevious commit hash\u003e`\n\nThis will create a new commit, with a message in the form\n\n    !fixup \u003coriginal commit message\u003e\n\nThen when you are at a stage you wish to squash and clean all your commits, just run a rebase with the `--autosquash` flag (or you can set\n`rebase.autosquash` to true in you git config).\n\nYou history would then go from:\n\n\u003ecommit 1234\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;!fixup Original change\n\n\u003ecommit 5678\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Some other change\n\n\u003ecommit 91011\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Original change\n\nbecoming:\n\n\u003ecommit 5678\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Some other change\n\u003e\n\u003ecommit 91011\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Original change\n\nWhere commit 91011, contains all the changes from the original `91011`, and `1234`\n\n\nRebasing commits can sometimes be a little scary if you don't know what you are doing or how it really works.\nSo squashing commits may not be for everyone, but I would still recommend everyone to put in more effort to their commit messages, as it can help\neveryone involved in modifying a codebase.\n"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"maintaining-a-clean-git-history"},"buildId":"HYlo68mGz6gwAzxLjubM4","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
