After trying to use it for a few months, I've now uninstalled it.\n\nI still really like the concept of configuring my system as code, especially the ability to define per-project environments without relying on containerisation or virtual machines. However, Nix has several flaws.\n\nThe biggest issue for me was the steep learning curve. I never fully grasped the Nix language, which made it difficult to make changes, particularly since I wasn't writing Nix code on a regular basis. The syntax and structure are unlike most other tools Iâ€™ve used, which made it harder to retain.\n\nOn top of that, the error messages were often hard to interpret. Small changes often resulted in build failures, which I then had to spend significant time debugging. The process of deciphering and fixing these issues became frustrating.\n\nIn the end, I found myself spending more time trying to get Nix to work than actually working on the projects it was supposed to support.\n\n\nFor now, I've decided to try out [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for managing my dotfiles, which you can see here: [https://github.com/Amwam/Dotfiles](https://github.com/Amwam/Dotfiles). I need to take some time and fully flesh out the configurations, but its a start. A few hours in and its already been easier to manager.\n\nI would like to find a nice way of configuring a new MacOS system via code, but so far I've not been able to find much. I suspect I'll dive into some shell scripts to help configure the system the way I like."},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"backing-out-of-nix-nixos-on-a-mac"},"buildId":"riXccdnVg_nTH3DsyqcA_","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
