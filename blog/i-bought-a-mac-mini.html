The latest M4 Mac Mini seems like a great deal. Amazing performance, and a (relatively) cheap price.
I&#x27;ve already got a monitor/keyboard/trackpad setup which I use for my main job, and an iPad I use when I travel, so this should fit into my setup quite nicely.
I&#x27;ve gone for a M4, 32GB, 1TB Mac mini. I&#x27;ve opted not to go for the Pro, mainly as I don&#x27;t feel like i need the extra performance.</p>
<h2>Why a new Mac?</h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to use an iPad as my main machine for some time now. It works well for day-to-day web browsing and email, but i&#x27;ve found it difficult to really do any sort of development with with. I&#x27;ve tried making use of <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> and running my own virtual machines. These have tended to work well, with the biggest issue being iPad OS. Its mouse and keyboard support make it difficult to be <em>truely</em> productive on it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also wanted to start exploring some software engineering items outside of my regular job, things that may not fit with what I do regularly. Having my own machine I can do that on is a major plus point.</p>
<p>There are also other admin activities I have to take care of, that I think would be better suited to a desktop computer. Using the iPad plugged in with Stage Manager <em>works</em>, but isn&#x27;t often ideal for my workflow.</p>
<h2>What do I want to do?</h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve got a bunch of ideas of things I want to explore, so here is a non-exhaustive list. I may not get around to all of these, but I itend to write up  journey.</p>
<h3>Dev tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Switching from <code>pyenv</code>/<code>virtualenv</code> to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/"><code>uv</code></a>.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I write a lot of Python code, <code>uv</code> seems to a favourite in the community. I&#x27;ve been using pyenv/virtualenv for over 10 years now, so now feels like a good time to start exploring other alteratives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shell environment.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I&#x27;ve been using <code>zsh</code> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/"><code>oh-my-zsh</code></a> for the majority of my career, and have never attempted to look into alternatives. I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m really making use of the functionality of <code>oh-my-zsh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix/NixOS</a> for declarative environments<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Reproducable environments has always been a positive in my experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vim/Neovim<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amwam.me/blog/my-vimrc">I setup a neovim configuration quite some time ago</a>, and haven&#x27;t changed it since. I used to work on a mix of Python 2 and 3 projects, so had a lot of configuration to deal with that. I suspect that theres probably more modern ways of doing the things I had configured. There was also a lot of plugins I added, which I&#x27;m not sure are really needed/used. I&#x27;m also not sure on the status of Vim vs Neovim, so worth looking into that too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docker for Mac alternatives<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Haven&#x27;t looked at other options for a while, but there are a few out there. I&#x27;d like to run some services on the new machine, and using containers feels like the easiest way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Just in general, I want to start experimenting a bit more, having a decenent machine I could run some LLMs locally will be useful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iOS/iPadOS/MacOS development<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I used to do a lot of this many years ago, things have changed so much, I&#x27;d like to get back into it. I&#x27;ve got a few ideas for apps I&#x27;d love to try and build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/">TailScale</a>
<ul>
<li>I already have this setup so that I can connect to my home network and use my AppleTV as an exit node. I&#x27;d also like to try and setup VSCode server, so that I could use my iPad on the go, connecting to the mac. Will also want to look at VNC options.</li>
<li>Also interested in setting up <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> again for DNS blocking, and running that from the Mac.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Home Automation<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I used to have a lot of smart switches around, but haven&#x27;t really got them setup yet (since moving).</li>
