{"pageProps":{"POST":"This is a follow up to [my previous post](https://amwam.me/blog/preventing-double-clicks-in-react), about preventing double clicks in React, this time using [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).\n\nWhen building interactive web applications, it's crucial to prevent users from accidentally submitting forms or triggering actions multiple times. One effective and user-friendly approach is to disable the button immediately after it's clicked.\n\n## The Problem\n\nConsider a form submission button:\n\n```javascript\nfunction SubmitButton() {\n  const handleSubmit = () => {\n    // Perform some action, e.g., API call\n    console.log(\"Form submitted!\");\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>;\n}\n```\n\nIf a user clicks this button twice quickly, the `handleSubmit` function will be called twice, potentially causing duplicate form submissions or API calls.\n\nWe can prevent double clicks by disabling the button immediately after it's clicked. Here's how we can implement this using React hooks:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nfunction submitForm() {\n  // Simulating an async action that returns a Promise\n  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n}\n\nfunction SubmitButton() {\n  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = React.useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async () => {\n    if (isSubmitting) {\n      return; // Prevent double submission\n    }\n\n    setIsSubmitting(true);\n\n    try {\n      // Perform some action, e.g., API call\n      await submitForm();\n      console.log(\"Form submitted successfully!\");\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error submitting form:\", error);\n    } finally {\n      setIsSubmitting(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isSubmitting}>\n      {isSubmitting ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down this implementation:\n\n1. We use the `useState` hook to create an `isSubmitting` state variable, this lets us track when some background action is being run.\n2. The `handleSubmit` function:\n   - Checks if the form is already submitting and returns early if it is.\n   - Sets `isSubmitting` to `true` before starting the submission process.\n   - Uses a try/catch block to handle the submission and any potential errors.\n   - Sets `isSubmitting` back to `false` in the `finally` block, ensuring the button is re-enabled even if an error occurs.\n3. The button's `disabled` prop is tied to the `isSubmitting` state, so that the user can't click it again to trigger the action.\n4. The button text changes to provide feedback to the user.\n\nWe can also take this a step further, and create our own hook to extract this logic.\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction submitForm() {\n    // Simulating an async action that returns a Promise\n    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))\n}\n\nexport function useIsSubmitting(action): [loading, action] {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(false);\n\n  function doAction(...x) {\n    setLoading(true);\n    return action(...x).finally(() => setLoading(false));\n  }\n\n  return [loading, doAction];\n}\n\nfunction SubmitButton() {\n  const [isSubmitting, doHandleSubmit] = useIsSubmitting(submitForm);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={doHandleSubmit} disabled={isSubmitting}>\n      {isSubmitting ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\n```\n\nThe final component doesn't need to handle any logic for reseting `isSubmitting`, and can focus on rendering the different states.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDisabling the button after it's clicked is a simple yet effective way to prevent double clicks and double submissions in React applications. This approach provides clear visual feedback to the user and ensures that actions are only triggered once, even if the user accidentally clicks multiple times. By combining this with proper error handling and timeouts, you can create a robust and user-friendly interface for your forms and action buttons.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
