{"pageProps":{"POST":"I added the ability to push to deploy.\n\nI found out about Git's 'push to deploy' feature today based on this [post](https://github.com/blog/1957-git-2-3-has-been-released) and figured its perfect for my setup!\nMy site is built so that I don't have to restart when a new post is added, which means silent updates.\n\nI already had a hook which would check out my repo, and pull the latest changes, whenever I pushed to the bare repo. \nThis makes things simpler as I can now choose exactly when I want to deploy.\n\nTo set this up, all you have to do is clone your repo on your server, as you would normally (`git clone http://path.to.your.repo`), \nthen run the following command to allow pushing into the repo.\n\n    git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead\n\n\nFrom your development side, setup a new remote such as `prod` with the command :\n\n    git remote add prod http://path.to.your.production.repo\n\nWhen ever you want to deploy it becomes a simple case of just running `git push prod master`.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
