{"pageProps":{"POST":"The [Mac Mini](./i-bought-a-mac-mini) arrived today!\n\nHave only done some basic setup so far, mostly logging into accounts.\n\nJumped straight in today, and installed [TailScale](https://tailscale.com/), so now I can access the mac from anywhere, using a VPN. I can also use the mac as an exit node if I want.\n\nAlso setup a VNC, so I can use my iPad when away (and also connected via tailscale). Seems like one of the most recomended solutions was [Screens](https://edovia.com/en/screens/). Easy to setup and get started, and works quite well.\n\nOnly been able to use it on my local network so far, but performance seems pretty good.\n\nNot a lot to share about the install experience yet, both these two applications didn't take up to get working.\n\nNext thing I'll likely start looking at is Nix, to install packages, I'm currently writing this via the GitHub online editor."},"__N_SSG":true}
