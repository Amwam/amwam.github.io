{"pageProps":{"POST":"[Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) is a new project from Mozilla.\nIt aims to bring python into the browser, making use of WebAssembly. You can read the full blog post at [https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/).\n\nI wanted to try it out, and see how easy it would be run python in the browser, while also being able to interact with the DOM, as I would normally do in javascript. Turns out, Pyodide makes this really simple. Pyodide will proxy javascript objects with their python counter parts, in a way that feels very seamless.\n\nAfter I had got the project setup, I decided to have a go and running a small React application, written in Python.\nAs React isn't actually dependant on JSX syntax, this is trivial to get running thanks to Pyodide. All React components just have to return `React.createElement` calls instead (which babel would normally translate JSX code into).\n\nThe result:\n\n```python\nfrom js import document, window\n\nReact = window.React\nReactDOM = window.ReactDOM\n\n\ndef HelloWorldReactComponent():\n    return React.createElement(\n        \"div\", {\"style\": {\"display\": \"flex\"}},\n        \"Hello world. This was rendered with React.\"\n    )\n\n\nReactDOM.render(HelloWorldReactComponent(), document.querySelector(\"#result\"))\n```\n\nYou can see a live demo at: [https://amwam-pyodide-testing.now.sh](https://amwam-pyodide-testing.now.sh) or alternatively the code at: [https://github.com/Amwam/pyodide-testing-playground](https://github.com/Amwam/pyodide-testing-playground)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
